# Statistical-analysis-on-Facebook-Metrics
Linear regression analysis is incorporated to model how user engagement on the Facebook page of a renowned cosmetic brand can improve the brand's online presence and boost revenue. With this the Cosmetic brand is able to determine what type of post received more engagement whether it is a photo, link, status, or video, paid for or not, created by action, product, and inspiration, and what day of the week, month and time the post was made. Other statistical tests performed on the dataset features are the Hypothesis test, Shapiro Wilk test, Analysis of Variance, and scatterplot matrix.  The results demonstrated how the attributes of social media posts may be used to anticipate by providing information on user involvement with a brand's social media page, the best type of posts to make, and the best time to publish.
